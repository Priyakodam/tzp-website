        <h2>Astronomy Outreach Program</h2>
        <p>
          The project, a collaborative effort between <strong>Tare Zameen Par Trust</strong> and <strong>Aviratha</strong>, aimed to bring the wonders of the universe to rural schools in Karnataka. The project involved organizing digital mobile planetarium shows to provide an immersive and educational experience to students in remote areas.
